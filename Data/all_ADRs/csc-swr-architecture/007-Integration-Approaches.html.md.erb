# 007. Integration Approach

Date: 2020-12-17

## Status

For Review

## Context

The Children's Social Care Alpha Service is seeking to pull together key data assets
such as Looked After Children and Foster Families. These will be sourced from Local
Authority (LA) and Independent Foster Agency (IFA) Care Management Systems (CMS'),
as well as central Departmental data collections such as SSDA903.

The SSDA903 collection and the CMS at LAs highlight the significance of individual
pathways through the Care System. Each individuals pathway can be regarded as a
series of events and touchpoints that the individual has had with various other actors
in the system, such as IFAs and Foster Families.

The existing SSDA903 dataset is analogous to an event stream, with the Local
Authorities (LAs) and Indedependent Fostering Agencies (IFAs) being event producers.

## Assumptions

* The Department's control over consumer environments, such as those run by LAs and IFAs,
is very limited so it should go to a reasonable common denominator. The assumption here
is that outbound access from their Social Care Systems to a REST API is possible in most situations.
* A flat file interface will be offered in those cases where the above is not possible.
* The [SSDA903 Technical Specification] can be used as a starting point for the events to collect.

## Decision

* Develop an API Gateway (see [Kong], [NGinx], [AWS API Gateway]) and REST Proxy, available primarily
to LAs and IFAs, serving an [Event Architecture] available internally.
* Use an Event Backbone (see [Kafka], [AWS Event Bridge]) to store and publish these events internally.
* Publish example client code on the Internet to ease LA and IFA adoption.
* Events will become the durable and persistent data which can be used to hydrate
the Department's services, such as Diary Log and Matchmaker Assistant,
* [Event Sourcing] should be trialled as a solution.

## Consequences

* Dedicated team to assist LAs and IFAs with their integrations - maybe not initially
but definitely once enough consumers are in need of assistance.
* Dedicated team to develop and operate the Event Store and associated API Gateway & REST Proxy
* Greater agility for future Departmental services once this integration has been proven and
data set and associated services can be used as the starting point for those services.

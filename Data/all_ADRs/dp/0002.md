# 2. Metadata will be stored in MongoDB

Date: 29/08/2017

## Status

Accepted

## Context

While developing APIs which store metadata about datasets, versions, filter jobs
and import jobs using Postgres, it has been found that some updates required
complex transactional updates across multiple tables.

We need to assess our data model and decide if a relational database
best fits this use case, or what alternative would be best.

## Decision

MongoDB will be used to store metadata for datasets, versions, filter and import
jobs. This allows us to prioritise the read heavy interactions, storing the
data in the same JSON format it will be presented to users.

## Consequences

1. Existing APIs and services will need to be refactored to use MongoDB instead
of Postgres

2. MongoDB databases will need to be set up for each environment

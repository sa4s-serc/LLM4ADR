# 3. Services should have default configuration values

Date: 29/09/2017

## Status

Accepted

## Context

When building new micro-services defaults were given to some configuration values so
applications would work locally 'out of the box'. This was not done for all values
or in all services.

There was discussion around whether it would be better for the service to
error/exit if any configuration value was not provided on startup, to be clear
on what needs to be set.

## Decision

All services will be built with default configuration values set - with defaults
that will most likely work when running services locally.

## Consequences

1. Some APIs and services will need to be refactored to include defaults where not set
2. Developer environments should work without needing to specify configuration

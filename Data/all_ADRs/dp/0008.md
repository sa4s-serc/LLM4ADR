# 8. Hierarchy and code list data is not market sensitive

Date: 01/03/2018

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Datasets are made up of observations and dimensions. Each of the options for a
dimension have wider definitions and metadata which apply to that option in all
scenarios, across multiple datasets. This dimension metadata is stored in APIs.

APIs which hold secure or market sensitive data must meet different NFRs with
regards to security and publishing. It is important to understand what data is
subject to these NFRs or not.

It was suggested that hierarchies and code lists may not be considered sensitive,
and so the APIs which control access to this data would not be subject to the
same NFRs.

## Decision

Hierarchies and code lists do not need to be published, and do not need a
preview option.

## Consequences

1. Changes to satisfy NFRs do not need to be made to the Hierarchy or Code list
APIs to meet data security requirements

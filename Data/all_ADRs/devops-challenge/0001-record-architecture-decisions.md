# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2020-02-17

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The goal of this challenge is to implement a support plaform for a
 microservices architecture with several requirements:

* is scalable on load
* is fully automated
* identifies Single Point of Failures
* implements resilience and fault tolerance mechanisms

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project as
 a way to document all the thinking and building process.  This will help
 others to answer their wondering questions about why and how this solution was
 implemented.

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

## Consequences

See Michael Nygard's article, linked above. For a lightweight ADR toolset, see Nat Pryce's [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools).

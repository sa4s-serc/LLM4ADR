# 2. Use clean architecture

Date: 15-July-2017

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to distinguish what our application does versus how it does it.

## Decision

We will use clean architecture to ensure a clear separation is maintained between what and how.
 
See [README.md](../../README.md) for details. 

## Consequences

Easier to reason about the application.

Easier to replace segments of the application without impacting the rest.

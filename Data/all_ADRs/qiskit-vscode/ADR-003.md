# 3. Use Google's TSLint rules

Date: 2018-06-21

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Some parts of the code were quite different and some "bad practices" started to appear. Because no person in the team is an expert in TS, we believe a stricter static analysis process could help.

## Decision

Because the community mainly accepts Google's TSLint rules as a good practice, we will use them.

## Consequences

On the one hand, we needed to fix some errors generated by the linter. On the other hand, some rules were quite strict for the current status of the code, so they were documented, and we will add them in the future.

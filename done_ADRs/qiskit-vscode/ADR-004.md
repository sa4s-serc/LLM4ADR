# 4. Nunjucks as a template engine

Date: 2018-06-26

Accepted

## Context

The visualization features of the project started as a spike, and the code is not very clear. We decided that a templates engine will solve some of the code problems and will make easier to create new visualizations in the future.

## Decision

The recommended options from the team were, React, Lit-HTML and Nunjucks. React looks like an excellent option, but had some problems with the current templates, so Nunjucks replaced it as the best option at this moment.

## Consequences

Nunjucks allows re-utilization, but the compiler does not understand the code itself. We will take the risk, for the time being, thinking that a future change to React will be the best option. Because the new structure of the visualization code, any change will be quite easy and more than one template engine could exist at the same time indeed.

# 2. Use ANTLR4 as a parser generator

Date: 2018-03-06

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We already have a parser for Open QASM files, but we are having problems to create the suggestions library because we haven't a valid AST available.

## Decision

We will use ANTLR4 and ANTLR4-C3 library to generate a parser which can return an AST. With the AST the ANTLR4-C3 library can return the valid tokens at the caret position.

## Consequences

Using a grammar quite similar to the existing one, ANTLR will generate a parser which will be easier to walk and transform leading to more natural to read and maintain code.

# 7. Filter Outputs should be created via a POST to /filter-outputs

Date: 16/12/2017

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Filters originally contained all details defining the selection and the static
content the selection generated. This was split, so the resource for defining
selections was separate to the outputs it created, which means a step is needed
to create the output resource on submission.

This could be achieved through a query parameter on the filter endpoint, so that
as a user is updating their filter they update it to submitted. This could also
be achieved by creating a new endpoint, which a user POSTs to and provides an
ID for the filter they wish to submit. Both options have the same limitation that
the filter may have been changed by another user between the last GET and when
it is submitted.

The new endpoint solution is considered more RESTful.

## Decision

The most RESTful solution of creating resources via a POST is preferable

## Consequences

1. A new endpoint needs to be created for filter outputs
2. Applications which submit filters will need to be updated for the new structure

# 6. Filters should be created by dataset/edition/version not instance identifiers

Date: 27/11/2017

## Status

Accepted

## Context

In order to create a filter, a user must provide a unique way of referencing
a specific version/instance document. Instance IDs uniquely identify the document
but it may not be clear to users what this ID represents.

It is likely that users understand which version, of which edition, of which
dataset they are interested in - and this also uniquely identifies the document.

## Decision

Filters should be created using a combination of dataset/edition/version IDs

## Consequences

1. Filter API will need to accept these fields
2. Instances do not need to be explained to a user or documented

# 9. Dimension options must be separate entities to codes

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Datasets are made up of observations and dimensions. Each of the options for a
dimension have wider definitions and metadata which apply to that option in all
scenarios, across multiple datasets. These code definitions live in code-lists.

When storing both datasets and code-lists in a graph database, there is some
overlap between the information stored on a code and on a dimension option. A
design decision was needed as to whether the dimension option and code nodes
in the graph database should be collapsed into a single node, with the relevant
relationships for each coming off that single node.

## Decision

Dimension options and codes should not be collapsed into a single node. Dimension
options have relationships to every observation within an imported dataset, and
adding those relationships to the code node would result in relationships to
every observation across all datasets - a significant and unnecessary burden.

## Consequences

1. Code nodes will be created separately to dimension option nodes in the graph
2. In order to list datasets which use a code, new relationships will need to be
built between the code-list graph and instance graph

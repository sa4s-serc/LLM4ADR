# Database Decision record

* **Issue**: Store basic documents. Our project requires persistent storage. We must find a way to store usersâ€™ annotations indefinitely, and we will likely also need to store copies of annotated websites in some form.

* **Decision**: We decided to use MongoDB as our database tool

* **Status**: Decided

* **Pros**: Popular, compatible with Node.js applications

* **Cons**: N/A

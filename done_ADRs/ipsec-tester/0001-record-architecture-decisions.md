# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2017-09-03

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADR), as described by Michael Nygard in this article: <http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions>.

## Consequences

One ADR describes one significant decision for this project.

The consequences of one ADR  are very likely to become the context for subsequent ADRs.

Developers and stakeholders can see the ADRs, even as the team composition changes over time.

The motivation behind previous decisions is visible for everyone, and the time to change old decisions will be clear from the changes in the project's context.

For a detailed description see Michael Nygard's article, linked above.

For a lightweight ADR toolset, see Nat Pryce's _adr-tools_ at <https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools>.

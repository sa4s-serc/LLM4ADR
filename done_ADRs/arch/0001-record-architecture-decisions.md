Architecture Decisions, what are they ?: [http://reasonofone.blogspot.hk/2014/08/architecture-decisions-what-are-they.html][2]

Architecture Decisions: Demystifying Architecture: [https://www.utdallas.edu/\~chung/SA/zz-Impreso-architecture\_decisions-tyree-05.pdf][3]

We will use adr-tools, as this file generated by [https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools][4]

# Use Snyk Vulnerability Scanning

* Status: accepted
* Deciders: @dynamike, @pjdufour-truss
* Date: 2018-08-13

## Context and Problem Statement

An area of security risk to MyMove is supply-chain risk.  In the context of software development, supply-chain risk is the risk that a malicious actor could insert malicious code somewhere into a source code dependency.  The actor could attack a dependency directly by modifying a git repo, upload bad code to a package manager, man in the middle during the build process, or a wide variety of other scenarios.

Scanning software for known vulnerabilities (e.g., CVEs) is a critical step for mitigating supply-chain risk.  However, it does not completely mitigate against zero-days, custom attacks, or other supply-chain attacks.

## Decision Drivers

* Seamlessly integrates into our CI/CD workflow
* Scans JavaScript for known CVEs
* Scans Golang dependencies for known CVEs
* Maintenance cost

## Considered Options

* GitHub
* Sonatype
* Snyk
* SonarQube
* Twistlock

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Use Snyk for Vulnerability Scanning".  We'll use `snyk test` and `snyk monitor` for one-time tests and monitoring of our dependency tree.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### GitHub

* Good, scans JavaScript
* Bad, does not scan Go
* Bad, run as a cron job scheduled by GitHub
* Bad, cannot run as part of our CI/CD workflow
* Good, no maintenance cost

### Sonatype

* Good, scans JavaScript
* Bad, [does not scan Go](https://issues.sonatype.org/browse/NEXUS-13785) at this time.
* Bad, it would require rearchitecting our entire CI/CD pipeline

### Snyk

* Good, scans JavaScript
* Good, scans Go
* Good, could fit into our CI/CD workflow with some shell scripting.
* Bad, GitHub integration requires write access to repos.
* Bad, [vulnerability database for Go](https://snyk.io/vuln/page/1?type=golang) seems limited.

### SonarQube

SonarQube is a leading open source product for continuous code quality, including a "quality gate" that integrates seamlessly into CI/CD workflow.

* Good, scans JavaScript
* Unsure, scans Go (not sure it scans for CVEs)
* Good, seamlessly integrates into CI/CD workflow
* Bad, requires running our own instance on EC2.

### Twistlock

Twistlock looks like it is working on [amazing things](https://www.twistlock.com/2018/08/07/announcing-twistlock-2-5-ga-release-notes/), but doesn't satisfy our requirements for scanning for known vulnerabilities before deploy.

* Good, container-first approach and we use containers.
* Bad, no deep scans for known vulnerabilities (CVEs)
* Bad, doesn't seamlessly integrate into our CI/CD workflow for this requirement.

# ADR 1: Record Architecture Decisions

Date: 2017-09-03

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Even though this is a small library project that may not have any decisions that qualify as a decision that `addresses a significant requirement`, there is still value in having historical documentation of certain design decisions. Historical documentation of such decisions allows others to see -- and ourselves to remember -- the reasoning behind why decisions were made.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as described by Michael Nygard.

## Consequences

In addition to the consequences documented by Michael Nygard in the article from above, we will also have a place to lookup historical decisions both for ourselves and for others that want to know why a decision was made.

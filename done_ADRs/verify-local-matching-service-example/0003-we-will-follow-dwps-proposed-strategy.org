* 3. We will follow DWP's proposed matching strategy

Accepted

** Context

DWP performed an investigation into matching using their dataset. They propose a
matching strategy which works well for their particular use case.

The following is a much-simplified version of the proposed matching strategy.

#+BEGIN_SRC plantuml :exports results :file images/flow.png
skinparam shadowing false
skinparam activity {
  BorderColor black
}

start
:Select all records matching any historical surname and date of birth;
if (One or more match?) then (yes)
  if (Postcode present in Verify matching dataset?) then (yes)
    :Filter only records matching any historical postcode;
    if (One or more match?) then (yes)
    else (no)
      #DF3034:No match;
      stop
    endif
  else (no)
  endif
  :Filter only records matching given name or middlename;
  if (Exactly one match?) then (yes)
    #00823B:Match;
    stop
  elseif (More than one match?) then (yes)
    if (Cycle 3 attribute present?) then (yes)
      :Filter only records matching Cycle 3 attribute;
      if (Exactly one match?) then (yes)
        #00823B:Match;
        stop
      else (no)
        #DF3034:No match;
        stop
      endif
    else (no)
      #DF3034:No match;
      stop
    endif
  else (no)
    #DF3034:No match;
    stop
  endif
else (no)
  #DF3034:No match;
  stop
endif
#+END_SRC

** Decision

We will implement the above matching strategy.

For simplicity, we will ignore any attributes where "verified" is set to "false".

** Consequences

This strategy should be a good starting point for services in similar situations
to DWP (large, pre-existing dataset, high chance of new users already being
present in the dataset).

The strategy may work less well for services in other situations, for example
those without a pre-existing database of users who plan on creating a new
dataset from Verify users.

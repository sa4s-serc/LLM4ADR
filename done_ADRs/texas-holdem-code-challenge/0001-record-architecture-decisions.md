# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2019-05-29

## Status

Accepted

## Context

In the in-person technical interview to follow, I will need to discuss why I
made the decisions I made.

## Decision

I will use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

## Consequences

Con:
 - It will take me a little longer because I'm writing thoughts down as I go.

Pro:
 - When it comes time to review it, both I and reviewers will have notes to
   refer to.
 - I will have a place to write justifications for decisions that I think are
   too big to put in my commit message body.

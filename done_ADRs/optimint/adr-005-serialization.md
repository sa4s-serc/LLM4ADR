# ADR 005: Serialization

## Changelog

- 2021-05-31: Created

## Context

All the basic data types needs to be efficiently serialized into binary format before saving in KV store or sending to network.

## Alternative Approaches

There are countless alternatives to `protobuf`, including `flatbuffers`, `avro`, `ASN.1`, `RLP`.

## Decision

`protobuf` is used for data serialization both for storing and network communication.
`protobuf` is used widely in entire Cosmos ecosystem, and we would need to use it anyways.

## Status

{Accepted}

## Consequences

### Positive

- well known serialization method
- language independent

### Negative

- there are known issues with `protobuf`

### Neutral

- it's de-facto standard in Cosmos ecosystem

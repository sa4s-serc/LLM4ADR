# 006. Postcode Lookup

Date: 2020-12-14

## Status

Approved

## Context

Postcode Validation/Verification, Address & Geocoding searches is a requirement in
the Diary Logging Service and more particularly in the Placement Shortlisting Service.
Currently there is no adopted DfE Architectural pattern for postcode searches, address
searches & Geocoding searches.

There is a Common Components Initiate (CCI) currently in development by DfE where several
SaaS offerings are being considered.  Postcode, address & geocoding is part of this initiative,
but this will not be approved and an adopted practise for some time. For further information see
[here](https://dfe-digital.github.io/architecture/common-components/#postcode-lookup).

CCI will also include Geospatial Mapping and the following products and service will
be available across the department:

* [Azure Maps]
* [Google Maps]
* [Bing Maps]

Each product provides a slightly different set of features and capabilities that
fit different use cases.


## Decision

This Alpha is working to build out a simple API postcode service, in the first utilising
[Postcodes.io].

Address validation and geocoding is not required during the alpha phase and
this decision will be replaced by a substantive revised decision, including address lookup
and geocoding when the detail of the data model is clear, and the project moves to the Beta phase.

A summary of the availability statistics for the services are available on this link:

* [Ideal Postcodes Status Page]

## Consequences

The clear consequence of this decision is to enable the development team to complete the
limited featured low-fi services for Diary Logging and Shortlisting & Matching Children
in care and prospective Foster Families during the alpha phase. This will be achieved
using [Postcodes.io].

Which format and structure should these records follow?

## Considered Options

* Follow winery project standard
* Deviate from winery project standard by using a different structure

## Decision Outcome

Follow winery project standard, using ["MADR 2.1.0"][MADR]

* See the related reasoning outlined in the [winery adr 0000][winery-adr]

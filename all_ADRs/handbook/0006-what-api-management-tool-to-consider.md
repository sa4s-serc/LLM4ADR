Technical Story: Design of Api Gateway / API Portal

## Context and Problem Statement

Is there available tool that is compliant to requirements?
Can the tool provide functionality for API Gateway?
Can the tool provide functionality for API Development Portal? 

### Requirements

Since the API Gateway is intended for students and startups to gather open government data, the following requirements need to be fulfilled.
The student / startup is defined as Consumer of service.
The organization that deliver the service as open service is defined as Provider of service.
The open service is hosted on organizations X-Road server.
The API Gateway must provide functionality for 
* Registration of services with rate limit
* Self-service portal
* API key for Consumer
* Rate limit for Consumer

#### Provider
* Register open service in API gateway.
* Set rate limit on open service in API gateway.

#### Consumer
* Register as service user.
* Register application intended to use API (Consideration).
* Get API key for that application or consumer.
* Register what API to use in the application.
* Ability to test the API from API console with application API key (Consideration).

#### Considerations
API Keys / Rate Limits
Is it sufficient to have only One API key for each Consumer, or is it required to define different Consumer applications with different API key. 
If a typical Consumer has created application and has valid API key, it is likely that he will not bother to register new application and get new API key. He could reuse the already given one.
Consumer could also use the ability to register another application and get new API key with fresh rate limits.

Consumer registration
What will be used to validate / approve students or startups for access on services.
Should it be registered by SSN or some unique id, or only by email, with ability to reregister with new email again and again.

## Decision Drivers

* Vendor lock in for runtime
* Open source or not
* Installation options
* Functional ability
* Market presence
* Pricing

Pricing model for API management solutions are complex. Usually based on transaction count, or CPU instances. Sometimes pricing is variation of annual fee and transactional fee.
All prices that are exposed in this documentation are estimates, needed to be negotiated with vendor.

There is consideration that most API management providers are aiming customers in hosted solutions, instead of on-prem installation, that would provide lock in for that vendor.

### Functional ability for decision

Functional ability to consider when evaluating the tool. The following list was taken from [wikipedia page for API Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API_management).

* Gateway: a server that acts as an API front-end, receives API requests, enforces throttling and security policies, passes requests to the back-end service and then passes the response back to the requester. A gateway often includes a transformation engine to orchestrate and modify the requests and responses on the fly. A gateway can also provide functionality such as collecting analytics data and providing caching. The gateway can provide functionality to support authentication, authorization, security, audit and regulatory compliance.
* Publishing tools: a collection of tools that API providers use to define APIs, for instance using the OpenAPI or RAML specifications, generate API documentation, manage access and usage policies for APIs, test and debug the execution of API, including security testing and automated generation of tests and test suites, deploy APIs into production, staging, and quality assurance environments, and coordinate the overall API lifecycle.
* Developer portal/API store: community site, typically branded by an API provider, that can encapsulate for API users in a single convenient source information and functionality including documentation, tutorials, sample code, software development kits, an interactive API console and sandbox to trial APIs, the ability to subscribe to the APIs and manage subscription keys such as OAuth2 Client ID and Client Secret, and obtain support from the API provider and user and community.
* Reporting and analytics: functionality to monitor API usage and load (overall hits, completed transactions, number of data objects returned, amount of compute time and other internal resources consumed, volume of data transferred). This can include real-time monitoring of the API with alerts being raised directly or via a higher-level network management system, for instance, if the load on an API has become too great, as well as functionality to analyze historical data, such as transaction logs, to detect usage trends. Functionality can also be provided to create synthetic transactions that can be used to test the performance and behavior of API endpoints. The information gathered by the reporting and analytics functionality can be used by the API provider to optimize the API offering within an organization's overall continuous improvement process and for defining software Service-Level Agreements for APIs.
* Monetization: functionality to support charging for access to commercial APIs. This functionality can include support for setting up pricing rules, based on usage, load and functionality, issuing invoices and collecting payments including multiple types of credit card payments.

## Decision Outcome

We recommend using hosted solution from **AWS** for API gateway. The reason is that if we look at the requirements and other architectural decisions in the project, the AWS solution does both fit in the architecture and pricing based on usage is cheaper than in other options.
We made a pricing estimate for five years. Based on 100 million API calls per month the price of using AWS is one third of bought enterprise or homemade solutions. If the usage is 20 million API calls per month, we are looking at one fifth of the enterprise solutions. Note that there is also cost in using the management API and storage cost of logging, but it seems to be fraction of the total cost of using the product.
Since the requirement is to host X-Road services that are defined as open and hosted at organization, we need to access the service through open X-Road server. Currently there will be installed X-Road server on AWS environment to use by island.is, that server can also be used by API gateway.
Downside is that all request needs to go to the AWS environment, and then go back to Iceland.
According to vendor lock in, then the investment cost of this option is not in the range that it will stop us to change to other solution. That could happen if requirement changes or the usage will be more than expected.
This decision is based on the requirements and intended usage. If those requirements change, for example we would use the API portal as portal for Viskuausan, or more intense usage is expected, other options could be more relevant.

Following is the decision phases used to get this conclusion.

### Second phase of decision
For Open Source tool, we recommend usage of **Kong Community Edition**, with custom made API Developer Portal and Analytics. The analytics part could be based on ELK stack through plugin. 
The Kong community is large, and there are some Developers Portals available in the Open Source community. There is also some plugin available for logging and monitoring available.
Kong API Gateway provides rest interface that can be used for customizing API Portal, and ability to create custom plugins for custom implementations.
This decision provides more custom code to be developed and we need to rely on that the community can provide plugins. 
We also rely on that the Kong product will remain open source, but lot of plugins are only available for Enterprise edition.

**WSO2** could be considered, since the whole suite is Open Source, so API Developer Portal and Admin UI is part of their Open Source offering. It is not recommend to use it without paid support plan.

For Vendor specific tool we recommend **Software AG API Management**. It is fully functional with customizable Developer Portal, and analysis tool.
It has both partner and customers in Iceland. Current pricing model is based on transaction count and same applies for On-Prem vs. Hosted implementations. 
There are no cloud provider or runtime lock in. Implementation is that the tool needs to be installed and configured. The Developer Portal needs to be customized.
For starter it is also option to host the installation at Advania for further evaluation. Analytics are fully integrated to ELK stack.

For hosted solutions, we recommend **AWS**, since it best fits the architectural decisions made for island.is

### First phase of decision
In the first decision phase the following tools were initially pinpointed for further analysis.
That was based on the option to run the API Management tool on premise. In decision outcome above, the tools have been narrowed to two options. 

If open source options are not a requirement, it is suggested to evaluate the following tools.

* [Software AG API Management](https://softwareaggov.com/products/integration/webmethods-api-management/)
* [IBM API Connect](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/api-connect)
* [Google Apigee Edge](https://apigee.com/about/cp/open-source-api-management)
* [Mulesoft Anypoint](https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/api-management)
* [Axway Ampify](https://www.axway.com/en/products/api-management) 


These are the tools that are most mature, and do not provide lock in for runtime platform.
They need to be evaluated based on pricing and technical ability.

If true open source is required, it is suggested to evaluate the following tools.

* [WSO2](https://wso2.com/api-management/)
* [Kong](https://konghq.com/)

These tools provide open source offering, but in most cases the features for Api Developer Portal and Publishing tools are only part of enterprise offering with subscription.
Evaluation is needed for validating if the open source offering of the tool contains what is needed for implementation. 
We need to evaluate pricing of enterprise offering against the price of creating/implementing required pieces, like custom Api Developer Portal. 

For hosted solution, the following options is considered

* [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/api-management/) 
* [Microsoft Azure API Management](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/api-management/)
* [Google Apigee Edge](https://apigee.com/about/cp/open-source-api-management)

Downside is that they are all platform dependent, to the owners proposed platform with more limited on-premise options. 
These are all top of the line tools according to capabilities.

For all considered tools we need to check what underlying software components are required. For example, data storage, queuing, and logging capacity.
We need to take into consideration effort and ability to build Developer portal, compared to customizing the tool offering.

Other tools that we looked at did in our opinion lack functionality or other ability for further considered, even though many of them could be considered.
Note that the list provided is not all existing Api Management tools, so other options might apply.

### Positive Consequences

* Api Management tools are listed and grouped based on if they have open source option or not.

### Negative Consequences

* All considered options are vendor lock in.

* Average, considered visionary by Gartner and strong performer Forrester
* Good, Sensedia is one of the few vendors in this market to support the growing demand for the creation and management of GraphQL endpoints. `Gartner`

### [Kong Community Edition](https://konghq.com/)

Price: Open Source.
Partners in Iceland: N/A
Usage in Iceland: Community edition is used in small setup, but not advertised.

Kong Community Edition is Open Source API Gateway. [GitHub](https://github.com/Kong).
The tool is managed by Rest services. There are quite few Open Source Admin tools like Konga (https://pantsel.github.io/konga/) and (https://github.com/pocketdigi/kong-admin-ui) that can be used to manage the API Gateway.
Everyone can write their own plugin to the product, and it has variety of options advertised (https://docs.konghq.com/hub/), Many plugins are only available in
Enterprise edition of the product, which require subscriptions and they are not Open Source. As a user you still have ability to either create your own plugin or find plugin for your need in 
Open Source community. For example plugin for OpenID Connect requires enterprise edition, but we can still find contributed plugin for that functionality (https://github.com/Optum/kong-oidc-auth).
The Community edition does not have Open Source Developer Portal. We have found at least one Open Source Portal on top of Kong (https://github.com/Haufe-Lexware/wicked.haufe.io).
Kong does not natively support OpenAPI, but plugin is available to define OpenAPI spec url to an endpoint. There are also some paid solutions built on Kong Gateway.
All GraphQL plugins are part of Enterprise Edition.
Risk factor is that future additions to Kong, will aim on Enterprise Edition.

Downloaded bundles from WSO2 site may not be used in production Environment. They include WS02 license that prohibit production usage without support subscription.

in contrast to most other offerings in this market. `Gartner`

# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2018-09-10

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Usabilla Architecture Chapter](https://github.com/usabilla/architecture-chapter/blob/master/docs/adr/0001-record-architecture-decisions.md).

## Consequences

Start to record all new architecture decisions and when necessary do a retroactive work to guarantee the knowledge base of this project.

# ADR 000: Using Architecure Decision Records

## Context

Architecture decisions often require thought over a longer period of time. It is useful to document various options and tradeoffs, both as a mechanism for exploring/discussing the solution space, but also as a record of decisions for review at later times.

[More motivation in the original blog post](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)

The process of carefully weighing tradeoffs of various options is summarized in [a post](https://data-sorcery.org/2010/12/29/hammock-driven-dev/) on Hammock Driven Development.

## Decision

We will maintain a series of Architecture Decision Records.

From the ADR blog post:

> ADRs will be numbered sequentially and monotonically. Numbers will not be reused.

> If a decision is reversed, we will keep the old one around, but mark it as superseded. (It's still relevant to know that it was the decision, but is no longer the decision.)

We will use the following outline

* Title
* Problem Statement
* Context
    * Related work (optional)
* Possible solutions (for each solution, list pros/cons)
* Decision
* Status
* Consequences

## Status

Accepted

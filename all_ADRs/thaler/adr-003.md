# ADR 003: Migration to Jellyfish Merkle Tree

## Changelog
* 02-04-2020: Initial Draft
* 02-04-2020: Minor Edits + Decision Updated
* 03-04-2020: Root Hash Kept in Chain Node State (for light client verification)
* 11-04-2020: Use dedicated version number rather than block height

## Context
For the authenticated integrity-checking storage of staking states, the prototype code has been using the [starling](https://crates.io/crates/starling) crate that implements "Merkle Binary Indexed Tree". This was choice, however, temporary
and needed to be revisited as a part of the stabilization effort (given this code is consensus-critical). 
The external crate itself had a few potential issues:

- *Not enough scrutiny*: most of its code has been written and maintained by a single author in the "best effort" way
- *Novel design*: while interesting and promising, custom data structures and algorithms have not been scrutinized much and deployed in critical settings
- *Documentation*: the only comprehensive documentation has been an informal blogpost  

## Decision
The code will be adapted to use the [Jellyfish Merkle Tree](https://github.com/libra/libra/blob/master/storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/lib.rs) structure from the Libra project as its authenticated integrity-checking storage of staking states.
The Jellyfish Merkle Tree offers the best tradeoff:

- it has received more scrutiny as a part of the Libra project development;
- its codebase is relatively small, well-documented and tested (or even formally verified);
- its codebase is licensed under a compatible license;
- the data structure itself is not too different from e.g. Ethereum-style MPT, 
while being optimized for PBFT-style consensus algorithms;
- it supports inclusion proofs, exclusion proofs and range proofs.

### Jellyfish Merkle Tree Codebase
As the current Libra codebase intertwines many of its crates,
the Jellyfish Merkle Tree code will initially be isolated in this fork: https://github.com/crypto-com/jellyfish-merkle-tree
In this fork, the codebase will be maintained, such that "jellyfish-merkle" can be a self-contained crate without
unnecessary dependencies.

### Integration
The existing code will be adapted in the following way:

- A `staking_version: Version` field will be added to `ChainNodeState`, which is initialized to zero, and increased by
  one when a block with at least one staking modifications commit.

- Two new columns `COL_TRIE_NODE`/`COL_STALE_NODE` will be added to store trie nodes in the same key-value store as other information.

- The `jellyfish_merkle::TreeReader` trait will be implemented for `GetKV`.

  ```rust
  struct KVReader<'a, S: GetKV>(&'a S);
  impl<'a, S: GetKV> TreeReader for KVReader<'a, S> {
      fn get_node_option(&self, node_key: &NodeKey) -> Result<Option<Node>> {
          self.0
              .get(&(COL_TRIE_NODE, node_key.encode()?))
              .map(|bytes| Node::decode(&bytes))
              .transpose()
      }
  
      fn get_rightmost_leaf(&self) -> Result<Option<(NodeKey, LeafNode)>> {
          unimplemented!("this feature is only used in merkle tree restore which we don't need yet");
      }
  }
  ```

- The `StakingGetter` with `JellyfishMerkleTree` will be implemented against any `GetKV`.

  ```rust
  pub struct StakingGetter<'a, S: GetKV> {
      storage: &'a S,
      version: Version,
  }
  
  impl<'a, S: GetKV> Get for StakingGetter<'a, S> {
      type Key = StakedStateAddress;
      type Value = StakedState;
      fn get(&self, key: &Self::Key) -> Option<Self::Value> {
          JellyfishMerkleTree::new(&KVReader::new(self.storage))
              .get_with_proof(HashValue::new(to_stake_key(key)), self.version)
              .expect("merkle trie internal error")
              .0
              .map(|blob| {
                  StakedState::decode(&mut blob.as_ref()).expect("merkle trie storage corrupted")
              })
      }
  }
  ```
  
- The buffer abstraction will remain as before:
  
  ```rust
  pub type StakingBufferStore<'a, S, H> = BufferSimpleStore<'a, StakingGetter<'a, S>, H>;
  pub type StakingBufferGetter<'a, S, H> = BufferGetter<'a, StakingGetter<'a, S>, H>;
  ```
  
- In the BlockCommit request processing, the staking buffer will be flushed into the Merkle trie,
its nodes will be written into the `StoreKV` buffer, which is the buffered key-value storage which contains other information in different columns (UTXO state etc.).
  
  ```rust
  pub fn flush_stakings<S: StoreKV>(
      storage: &mut S,
      version: Version,
      buffer: StakingBuffer,
  ) -> Result<(usize, usize)> {
      let reader = KVReader::new(storage);
      let tree = JellyfishMerkleTree::new(&reader);
      let (_, batch) = tree.put_blob_sets(
          vec![buffer
              .values()
              .map(|staking| (HashValue::new(staking.key()), staking.encode().into()))
              .collect::<Vec<_>>()],
          version,
      )?;
      for (key, node) in batch.node_batch.iter() {
          storage.set((COL_TRIE_NODE, key.encode()?), node.encode()?);
      }
      storage.set(
          (COL_STALE_NODE, version.encode()), 
          batch.stale_node_index_batch.encode()
      );
      Ok((batch.num_new_leaves, batch.num_stale_leaves))
  }
  ```
  
- The complete block commit processing will be done as follows at the end:
  
  ```rust
  flush_staking(&mut kv_store!(self), version, staking_buffer);
  flush_kv(&mut self.kvdb, kv_buffer);  // Write to the disk atomically.
  ```

### Chain Node State Changes

- `AccountStorage` will be removed from `ChainNodeApp` (as the node storage will be in the dedicated `COL_TRIE_NODE` column).


### Staled Trie Nodes Cleanup

When a node is modified, its old version is staled. The keys of staled trie nodes will be stored in the dedicated `COL_STALED_NODE` columned, indexed by the version number where they became staled.

Pruning of these staled trie nodes (e.g. in the context of validator operation where only the most recent version is needed)
is outside of the scope of this ADR.

### Implementation Steps

The work needed for this migration will be split into two PRs:

1. A jellyfish module will be added in `chain-storage` (this module will implements all the integration groundwork mentioned above).
2. The storage will be switched to use the jellyfish module and the starling-related code (`AccountStorage` etc.) will be removed.

## Status

Accepted

## Consequences

### Positive

- Better integration with the existing buffer storage abstraction; all Chain node state modifications can be done in a  single batch write operation during the BlockCommit request processing
- More robust trie data structure and algorithms

### Negative

- Extra maintenance of the isolated crate in the forked repository and possibly divergence from the upstream repository

### Neutral

- No support for forks because of the monotonically increasing version number: this is not an issue for Tendermint
(or equivalent deterministic-finality consensus algorithms), but for probabilistic-finality consensus algorithms
- One more repository
- One "rocksdb" instance (as the nodes will be stored in one column rather than in a separate database instance)
- When query history staking state, convert the request block height to version number through history `ChainNodeState` first

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

## Decision

In the context of making several architecture and design decisions for this site, I was concerned that I would not have a way to audit and learn from them. So I decided to use Architecture Decision Records, as described by Michael Nygard in [this article][1], to achieve better learning outcomes in the future. I accept it's more work to do so.

## Consequences

- Maintain an ADR using [phodal adr package][2]

# 5. Florence screens should only update one Dataset API document

Date: 16/10/2017

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Additional screens for the publishing workflow were designed given all the
possible fields regardless of how they are retrieved or edited from the API.

These fields were broken down into suggested logical groupings for users to edit.
This separation means multiple API calls could be needed to save updates on a
single screen, and that datasets will have to be added with versions depending
on which fields are updated (going against [decision 0004](0004.md)).

## Decision

Screens should be separated to update either the dataset or version metadata
but not both in one.

## Consequences

1. Fields will have to move to different screens
2. No API changes should be required as a result of this decision

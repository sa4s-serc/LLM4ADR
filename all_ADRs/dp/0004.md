# 4. Datasets can be edited in a different collection to their versions

Date: 16/10/2017

## Status

Accepted

## Context

When designing APIs to handle metadata about datasets, editions and versions
no particular limitations were placed on which order these documents should be
edited in.

In the existing publishing workflow, a single item can be added to only one
collection at a time. As the APIs have separated formerly joined concepts, it
is necessary to understand whether datasets can be edited or published in
isolation from versions.

## Decision

Adding a version to a collection does not prevent the dataset being edited in a different collection

## Consequences

1. Adding a version should not require changing the dataset metadata
2. Datasets can be added to a collection directly

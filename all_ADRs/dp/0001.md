# 1. Public beta will be hosted on beta.ons.gov.uk

Date: 29/08/2017

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to decide whether the Customise My Data beta will be hosted
as part of the existing ONS website and infrastructure, or whether
it will be hosted independently.

## Decision

The beta will be hosted on beta.ons.gov.uk, on its own dedicated infrastructure.
This reduces the risk of CMD-specific changes impacting on our existing service.

## Consequences

1. Links in page furniture (e.g. taxonomy, contact us) need to be changed to
   point at the existing ONS website to avoid a broken user journey

2. Pages on the existing ONS website will need to point to the beta.ons.gov.uk domain

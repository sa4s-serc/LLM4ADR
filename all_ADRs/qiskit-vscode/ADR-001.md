# 1. Use Jison as a parser generator

Date: 2018-02-27

## Status

Superseded

## Context

We need a parser to be able to validate syntactically and semantically an Open QASM file. And a previous one with its grammar is already available from QX.

## Decision

We will use Jison and the original Open QASM grammar from the QX project.

## Consequences

It is not the most advanced parser generator, but it will allow us to create the first version of qiskit-vscode in a few days.

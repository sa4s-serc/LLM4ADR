Its modern architecture and growing popularity make it a strong candidate for developing a feature-rich application like Tasky. Additionally, Flutter's integration capabilities can ensure that Tasky remains responsive and efficient while accessing critical device features directly.\n\nStarting with Flutter can facilitate a smooth beta release, and its flexibility means you can further optimize or add features as per user feedback.",

This is essential for implementing Tasky's hands-free operation feature and leveraging on-device text-to-speech capabilities effectively.\n\n5. **Notifications**: With Flutter, you can easily implement push notifications using plugins like Firebase Cloud Messaging, which supports features such as topic-based subscriptions and notification customization that are critical for a task management app.\n\n6. **Active Community and Support**: Flutter has a large and supportive community, which means you can easily find resources, tutorials, and third-party plugins to accelerate development and troubleshoot any issues.\n\nGiven these advantages, Flutter checks all the boxes for Tasky's requirements by providing a robust, efficient, and scalable platform for your app's development.",

This supports high throughput scenarios while minimizing code complexity.\n\n### Positive Consequences\n* Allows for high throughput and efficient use of resources as it avoids locking mechanisms during transaction execution.\n* Simplified maintainability compared to pessimistic locking, reducing the amount of additional code needed for managing locks.\n* Less prone to deadlocks since locks are not held throughout the operation.\n\n### Negative Consequences\n* Possibility of increased conflict resolution processing if a high volume of data versions conflict during commits.\n* May require additional logic to handle retries in case of a version conflict.\n\nThe change we are proposing or have agreed to implement is to use a version number field on entities within the system to manage concurrent changes. When updates are attempted, the version number will be checked against the current database version to confirm that no other transaction has committed changes during the process.

This will minimize the need for tracking state between mouse and pointer events.\n\n2. **Safari and Non-supporting Environments Fallback:**\n   - Implement a conditional check for the availability and reliability of PointerEvents.\n   - In cases where PointerEvents and movementX/movementY properties are unsupported or unreliable (detected via feature checks or specific browser detection for Safari), fallback to using MouseEvents for capturing movement data.\n   - Calculate mouse movement (delta) manually by storing and comparing the previous mouse coordinates against the current ones on MouseMove events.\n\n3. **Gradual Enhancement on Safari:**\n   - Monitor developments in Safari's experimental PointerEvents API, and prepare for potential updates that may support movementX and movementY in the future.\n   - Consider adding feature detection scripts to automatically enable future support without major refactoring when the API matures.\n\n4. **Documentation and Testing:**\n   - Thoroughly document this fallback approach to ensure clarity and maintainability.\n   - Conduct comprehensive testing across different browsers and devices to ensure consistent behavior and performance.\n\nBy taking this hybrid approach, we can ensure a functional and adaptable solution across all targeted environments, while being ready to leverage future improvements in browser support.",

This allows us to emulate the movement indicators irrespective of native support.\n\n3. **Feature Detection**: The application will incorporate feature detection to dynamically choose the appropriate event API based on the browser\u2019s capabilities. This will minimize the performance overhead and ensure a seamless user experience.\n\n4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Given that mobile is a secondary concern, the focus will be on optimizing desktop environments first, ensuring Safari compatibility on desktops using the hybrid system, and gradually improving the mobile experience over time.\n\nBy following this decision, we ensure our application remains functional across different browsers and devices while gracefully handling Safari\u2019s current limitations.",

Confidentiality Measures: Implement strict confidentiality agreements for the arbitration process to ensure that any disclosed proprietary information remains protected.\n\n5. Assessment Criteria: Establish clear criteria for determining a breach, which includes evidence of access to proprietary designs during employment, similarity in design post-departure, and any documented intent to share or profit from such designs.\n\n6. Timeline: Set a clear timeline for the arbitration process to ensure it is completed in a timely manner \u2013 ideally, within 90 days from the initiation of the process.\n\n7. Determination of Damages: If a breach is found, expert valuation analysts will assess the financial impact on the startup, considering factors like lost revenue, competitive advantage, and any contractual penalties outlined in the NDA.\n\n8. Binding Resolution: Both parties agree in advance that the arbitration\u2019s findings and decisions will be final and binding to minimize protracted legal disputes.\n\nBy following this structured approach, the ADR will ensure a fair, thorough, and efficient arbitration process to address the NDA violation claim.",

Zero Trust assumes no implicit trust and verifies every access request regardless of its origin, while layered security implements multiple, overlapping security controls at different levels.\n\n## Justification\n\nThis combined approach provides comprehensive protection against modern cyber threats.  Zero Trust addresses the increasing complexity of networks and the rise of insider threats by eliminating the concept of a trusted internal network. Layered security adds redundancy and resilience, ensuring that if one layer fails, others are in place to mitigate the attack.  This combined model significantly reduces the attack surface and limits the blast radius of any successful breach.\n\nSpecific technologies and practices within this architecture will include:\n\n* **Microsegmentation:** Dividing the network into smaller, isolated segments to limit the impact of a breach.\n* **Identity and Access Management (IAM):**  Strict access controls based on the principle of least privilege, including multi-factor authentication (MFA).\n* **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**  Monitoring network traffic for malicious activity and blocking or alerting on suspicious patterns.\n* **Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFWs):** Advanced firewalls with deep packet inspection capabilities to identify and block sophisticated threats.\n* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**  Collecting and analyzing security logs from various sources to detect and respond to security incidents.\n* **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):** Monitoring endpoint devices for malicious activity and providing real-time threat detection and response.\n* **Data Loss Prevention (DLP):**  Preventing sensitive data from leaving the organization's control.\n* **Regular Security Assessments and Penetration Testing:**  Identifying vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the security posture.\n* **Security Awareness Training:**  Educating users about security best practices and threats.\n\nThis architecture is chosen over other potential options such as solely perimeter-based security or a single vendor security solution due to its flexibility, scalability and robust defense against modern threats.\n\n\nThis decision will be reviewed and updated at least annually or as needed due to significant security incidents or changes in the threat landscape.\n",
